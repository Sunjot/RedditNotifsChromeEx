# RedditNotifsChromeEx

A Chrome Extension that sends you desktop notifications for new posts on /r/trap. In the settings window of the extension, you enter words that are of interest to you, such as an artist name, that get added to a list. The extension periodically checks for new posts on the /r/trap subreddit that contain any of the words in the list and sends you a desktop notification with the title of the post if they do.
